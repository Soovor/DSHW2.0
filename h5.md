x) Read and sum

Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations

- The messages are plaintext (or cleartext in some cases). Encryption is the process of masking a message's content in order to hide it.

- A ciphertext represents an encrypted message.

- Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext into plaintext.

- Cryptography is the art and science of protecting messages.

- Cryptanalysis is the science and art of deciphering ciphertext, or seeing through the mask.

- Cryptology, a field of mathematics that includes both cryptanalysis and cryptography, is practiced by cryptologists.

- Data confidentiality is the main goal of cryptography, but it is also used for authentication and data integrity verification.
