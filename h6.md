Rob Joyce, the Senior Advisor for Cybersecurity Strategy at the National Security Agency (NSA), kicked off the 26th DEF CON. This wasn't his first time attending a hacker convention. He also stated that he activley recruited interested individuals throughout the conference.

He started by stating that more than half of worlds population is online and many are adapting to the "World Wide Web" every day. More and more things are offered on the Internet such as - social networks, investing in cryptocurrency and online businesses. This puts a lot of unaware people in danger of getting their information stolen and sold on the Dark Web, or even worse - entire state networks getting broken into.

Major cybersecurity incidents have included:

- The attack on Ukraine's electrical grid in 2016; 
- The WannaCry ransomware attack from North Korea that rendered computers in 150 countries unusable in 24 hours in 2017;
- The Russian cyberattack on the 2018 Winter Olympics, which knocked out Internet and Wi-Fi access and the Olympics website for 12 hours;

Joyce also covered the current threats to the United States and the field of cyber security. He pointed out the fact that while the level of expertise required for hacking has decreased, high-end cyber threat activity has continued to advance.

The reason for this change is that hackers can now more easily use new Internet tools. According to Joyce, hacking has evolved from passive exploitation to active operation and organizational disruption.

Numerous Chinese hacking attempts did not aim to harm or even disrupt systems. Joyce pointed out that the Chinese hacks were actually part of a cyberespionage campaign.

Surprisingly, Joyce looked at the growing use of information operations that employ cyber intrusions to spread false information. Cyber intrusions have been used to create fake accounts or extra followers on social media platforms. As we've seen during election cycles, this practice enables threat actors to promote a narrative or launch malicious propaganda campaigns.

Some attendees looked into job opportunities with the NSA as a result of Joyce's speech. This organization keeps using cutting-edge technology for cyber defense, like analytics tools and the information obtained from them.

To inform the impacted sectors about cyberthreats, the NSA collaborates with the Department of Homeland Security. According to Joyce, agencies and other organizations will communicate more in the future to prevent cyber threats to the US.
