Santos et al: The Art of Hacking (Video Collection)

 Passive Reconnoissance: 3.0 - 3.4: 


- Researching information that is readily accessible without sending information to the target and setting off alarms.

- You should follow this step because neglecting it may result in the loss of crucial information or vulnerabilities, targeting the incorrect systems, or alerting the target.



There are several methods you can use to find the host and port information:


- Online directories ('Google dorks')
- Transparency in certificate issues (finding issued certificates)
- Prediction of hostnames (using nslookup to determine if the target exists)
- Internet registries for specific regions (IP lookup, subnets, contact details)
- Searches on 'Netcraft', 'Shodan.io', or 'Censys.io' (to search scan results of systems that are reachable online)



- Utilizing search engines such as 'Google Dorks' for file types like 'PDF', 'XLSX', 'TXT', metadata, and etc. you can locate information within files that belong to organizations.

- Using data breaches, 'paste' sites, the 'Google Hacking Database', or other resources, you can discover names, passwords, and other private information which belongs to an organization.


Active Reconnaissance: 4.0 - 4.3:

Actively gathering information about the target by sending data that may trigger the alarms using techniques like:


- Port scanning with programs like 'Nmap', 'Masscan', and 'UDPProtoScanner' to confirm open ports.
- Web Service Review using 'EyeWitness' (prioritizing target web applications).
- Screening for vulnerabilities (determine external and internal vulnerabilities)


Lyon 2009: Nmap Network Scanning: Chapter 15 - Port Scanning Basics:


Nmap can be used with the command:

    nmap {target IP}


Nmap can recognize six types of port states:


- OPEN: Application is accepting TCP connections, UDP datagrams, or SCTP associations.
- CLOSED: Port is accessible, but no application is listening to it.
- FILTERED: Packet filtering (by firewall, router rules, or other) prevents the detection of an OPEN or CLOSED port and require alternative scan types to be used.
- OPEN|FILTERED: Unable to determine OPEN or FILTERED port state as the OPEN port doesn't respond because of missing functions or packet filtering.
- CLOSED|FILTERED: Unable to determine CLOSED or FILTERED port state.


a) My networks.


 Adding a new 'vboxnet' internal network to 'VirtualBox':



- Click on the bullet list next to tools and select "Network".



- Press "Create" to create a new network.



- Select the new network and click "Properties".



!! Check that the DHCP Server is enabled and the network is configured correctly / not using an already existing IPv4 address.


b) Punchbag
 
 Installing the 'Metasploitable 2' practice target:



- Download the 'Metasploitable 2' from 'RAPID7' or "Sourceforge".


- Extract the 'Metasploitable.vmdk' file from the downloaded ZIP to your desktop.


- Open 'VirtualBox' and select "New".



- Name the VM, OS type - 'Linux', select version 'Debian (64-bit)', and select 'Use an existing virtual hard disk file', where you choose the 'Metasploitable.vmdk' file.

Connecting it to the new virtual network: 



- Select the 'Metasploitable2' VM and go to settings.



- Navigate to Network and select 'Attached to:' as 'Host-Only Adapter'.



!! Make sure that the name of the adapter matches the one that you created earlier.


Logging into 'Metasploitable 2' and finding its IP address: 


- Start the 'Metasploitable 2 VM' and login using: 


    Name: msfadmin
    
    
    Password: msfadmin



- To find the IP address type 'ifconfig' and look at the "inet" address of "eth0"

 c) Hero arrives.
 
 
 Connecting 'Debian 11 Bullseye' to the same network:



- As before, select the the 'Debian VM' and go to settings.



- Navigate to Network and set "Attached to:" as "Host-Only Adapter".



- Confirm that the name of the adapter is the same as the one that you created earlier.



- The virtual machines should now be part of the same network.


 d) Hello sploitable!
 
 
 Accessing 'Metasploitable 2' from 'Debian 11 Bullseye': 


- Start the 'Metasploitable2 VM' and the 'Debian Bullseye VM'.


- Open a browser (i.e 'Firefox') in the 'Debian Bullseye VM'.


- Put the inet IP address that you found earlier into the address bar and hit 'Enter'.


- The page displaying this 'ascii' should open:

 e) Explain 2. Port scan 'Metasploitable 2'. 
 
 
Port scan 'Metasploitable 2' and analyze:



'Nmap' is installed with this command:

    sudo apt install nmap


!! Double-check that the 'Metasploitable 2' page is still reachable and you have no Internet connection so that you don't accidentally attack something else, or even worse - someone else. (don't get yourself on some list ok? PSA over)


Scan the first 1000 ports of the 'Metasploitable 2' target using:


    sudo nmap {inet IP address of Metasploitable2}


A few OPEN ports pop up but the most notable ones are:


- Port 22/tcp - the port used in 'SSH', remote control of the host. (very important)


- Port 80/tcp - the port used for the Internet communication protocol which sends and receives UNENCRYPTED trafic from websites.
